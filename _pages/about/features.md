#### What is the WCT?  
The WCT is a free open source workflow management tool for selecting, crawling websites, performing quality assurance and preparing websites for ingest into a preservation system.

Recent releases have focused on upgrading the crawler to Heritrix 3, a complete modernisation of the underlying technical libraries, an easier installation process, and improved documentation.

#### What's next?  
We are focused on building version 4, which will improve the WCT's QA features.  It includes Pywb integration, crawling and patching using the libraries that underpin WebRecorder, bulk import and pruning, and an improved harvest visualisation.
