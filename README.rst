About the Web Curator Tool suite of applications
================================================

The Web Curator Tool is a suite of tools and applications for managing the selective web harvesting process. It is
typically used at national libraries and other collecting institutions to preserve online documentary heritage.

Unlike previous tools, it is enterprise-class software, and is designed for non-technical users like librarians.
The software was developed jointly by the National Library of New Zealand and the British Library, and has been
released as free software for the benefit of the international collecting community.

Where to find more information
==============================

The primary source for WebCurator Tool documentation is the `WebCurator documentation repository`_. This documentation
covers the various components that interact and work with each other to complete the selective web harvesting process.
